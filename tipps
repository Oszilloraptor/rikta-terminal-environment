# Shell Tricks

There are many tricks for the shell, but many are unknown by some poeple, so here are my favorites I use almost  every time.

I assume that the fundamental basics, like piping and redirecting of the stdin and stdout are already present ;)

All these commands will work in a plain bash, without any additional software

## history-replacements

The following operators will be replaced on executing the command

### `!!`

will be replaced by the last command, especially usefull if you forget sudo: `sudo !!`.

*or you use the "please"-alias of this repo*

### `!*`

will be replaced by all commands all arguments of the last command, especially 

### `!<n>`

will be replaced by command <n> of the history.
Most usefull after a call to `history`

*especially usefull if you combine it with an `history | grep <term>`, or the alias `hg <term>` of this repo*

### `^<old>^<new>`

Executes the last command, but replaces the first occurence of `<old>` with `<new>`

## other stuff

### escaping aliases

If you want to use the original command instead of an alias that overrides it, you can just prepend a slash

### expand command

ever wanted to know what you will actually execute if you use `*` in your commands? Just press `STRG`+`X`+`*` and you command will expand to the actually executed version

## keyboard-shortcuts

### Enter multiline commands in the CLI

Press `STRG`+`X`, followed by `STRG`+`E`, and you will open an editor for your command.

*If you use the `ENV.sh` of this repo, this will be `nano` by default*

### Go to the beginning/end of the line

Press `STRG`+`A` to set you cursor to the beginning of the command,
use `STRG`+`E` to go to the end.
Use `STRG`+`X`+`X` to go to the other end.

## funny stuff

### insults on sudo

If you are tired by the default "Permission denied" when you enter a wrong password on sudo, you can enable the "insult"-mode, where the cli will instead make fun of you.

Just enter `sudo visudo` to open the sudo-settings and add the line `Defaults insults`
